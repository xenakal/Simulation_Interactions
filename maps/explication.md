# Map folder

You have to place the map you want to test in this folder.

If you create a new map with the GUI interface, you will find the map also here. 
The name of this map is : Created_map.txt

If you save the current map you are testing, it will also be saved in this folder under the 
following name : Current_map.txt

!! Be careful !! Every time you create a map or you saved a one, it will erase the last one.
