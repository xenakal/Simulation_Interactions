The \notreVocabulaire{agent user} clusters \notreVocabulaire{agents sensors}. It collects data coming from multiple sources and operates a fusion to summarize the essential content to the user . It plays a passive role because it cannot give orders to an other agent.\\

The fusion process is possible because each information received about a target contains a timestamp and a confidence coefficient. When multiple data are received for the same target, the \notreVocabulaire{agent user} compares information and keeps the more recent one with the higher confidence.
