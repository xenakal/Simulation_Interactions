\subsection{Agent network conceptualization}
\label{Agent_newtork_conceptualization}
In the following section we will describe the system in a general way using sensors and not cameras. Furthermore the network always try to optimize those two criterion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduce as much as possible the need for communications.
    \item Algorithm with a low complexity because we consider a small computational power.
\end{itemize}

In such a system most of the communication processes complexity grows in $O^n$. When considering less then five agent it does not matter but if there are hundred of them it can become a problem. Therefore it seems important to reduce as much as possible the communication. 

\subsubsection{Network main structure}
A network is a structure composed by multiple agent. The definition of agent varies slightly and every one does not agree  the same definition so let's clarify it before going futher. In the system, the agent are defined as followed : 
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item Autonomous :  
    \item Sociable :
    \item Reactive :
    \item Pro-active :
\end{itemize}

As shown in the figure \ref{fig:Network_overview} the network is rather simple and composed by two type of agents. Arrows in the bloc diagram represent how information flows. Data are given to the first layer that is a set of \notreVocabulaire{agent sensors}. This layer acts as a filter and transmits the relevant information from the data to the second layer which is called \notreVocabulaire{agent user} and is the output.\\

It is also important to point out that agents are equals from a hierarchical point of view and can communicate together at anytime. Their specific role is clarified in the following sections.
