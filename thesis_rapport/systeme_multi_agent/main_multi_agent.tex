\section{Multi-agent network}


\subsection{Motivation}

There are more and more low-cost electronics cards available on the market. The raspberry PI or the Jetson Nano are two of those card. The computational power is definitely reduced when comparing to a computer. However for the same price it is possible to use multiple those and they can operate together in order to achieve a given task.\\

There are multiple  \textcolor{orange}{(two main)} reasons to give priority to a distributed system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system is more robust in the sense that a failure in one part does not affect completely the all system. For instance if one of the raspberry fails, then one of the sensor is lost but the others can still operate in the way they were. 
    \item The system is completely scalable. To receive more data, one can had a sensor without modifying the all structure. It will start to communicate with other one in order to participate and fulfill their common goal. 
\end{itemize}
